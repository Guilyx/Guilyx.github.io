Here you will find blog posts about our before, during and after being at CERN, but also learning materials catered to anyone that finds themselves in a similar situation to us. 
Why I felt the need to add learning materials to this:
- the information we've received in the process seems at times to not exist on the internet
  - or it exists but only at a graduate school level
-  this also helps me get a clearer, more peripheral picture of our experiment
