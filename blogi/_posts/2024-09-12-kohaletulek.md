Väga varajase algusega reisipäev. Lendasime kohale läbi Amsterdami. Need vaated, mis Hollandi kohal paistsid olid küll uskumatud. Iga puu oli strateegiliselt paigutatud, põllud olid standardsete kujudega ja isegi jõgi voolas ühtlase laiusega. Amsterdam ise tundus äge, seal olid kõrghooned ja ka omapärased punasest telliskivist majad, nende vahel looklesid jõesopid. Aa ja lennujaama kõrval oli kummaline kuppelmaastik. Kohale jõudse võttis meid vastu Pretzeli kotikesega krapsakas Markus ja temaga koos oli Jean-Pierre. Nad ei tundunud omavahel kohutvalat tuttavad, aga mõlemaga oli lihtne rääkida. Markus rääkis meile jura mägedest. CERN-i jõudmine oli üllatavalt lihtne: võtad lihtsalt trammi kirjaga CERN ja oledki kohal alla 20 minutiga (linnasüdamest sinna siuke 30min). Kampus ise oli kohutavalt futuristlik. Sees võtsime kingad ja kohtusime esimese eestlasega: .
VIPide esitluse päev. 

Vaja välja tuua:

I was Saskia's Estonian and literature teacher for 4 years. Even though I no longer teach her, that doesn't mean I no longer know what she is up to. 
Our school encourages every class to keep up their own blog where they disclose what the students do besides of regular classes. The manager of her class was Saskia herself. Even though the articles were occasionally outsourced from other classmates, Saskia's articles were always distinguishable from the rest, since she didn't write it as a report. Instead she added her own touch of humor and sarcasm into the blog posts, making them a very nice read. 
Though the class blog is no longer her priority, she has transferred her skill of writing engaging blog posts to creating a blog about her scientific ventures, i.e what was the story behind the stratospheric flights and what led her to CERN. 
She is also not afraid of public speaking, in fact, she always uses the oppurtunity to do so. Though I know that most of her public speaking is done outside of the school, hence, outside of my periphery, I still believe that she shines there as bright as she did for example during the graduation speech. 
To sum up, Saskia's strongest advantage is surprisingly not the scientific/physics side itself. Yes, it is remarkable, but even more remarkable is her combination with soft skills. Coupled with her leadership traits, she will have a competitive advantage in whatever path she chooses to go down.
